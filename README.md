🛡️ Tower Defense Game – JavaFX Project

This is a Tower Defense game developed using JavaFX, featuring 5 distinct levels (maps). Each map contains a winding path where raiders (enemies) enter the screen from a starting point and attempt to reach an exit point at the end of the path. Enemies appear in three waves per map, increasing in difficulty.
🗺️ Game Mechanics

    Enemy Movement: Raiders follow the designated path using PathTransition animations.

    Tower Building: Players can place towers at specific, predefined locations on the map. Each tower has unique strengths and automatically fires at nearby raiders until they are destroyed.

    Health System: If a raider reaches the end of the path and exits the screen, the player's health is reduced.
